# End-to-End Credit Card Fraud Detection ðŸš€

## Overview

A beginner-friendly, real-time machine learning project for credit card fraud detection, with model deployment, API streaming, and a live monitoring dashboard.

---

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/` â€” EDA, modeling, and feature engineering notebooks
- `models/` â€” Final model artifacts (`fraud_xgb.joblib`)
- `app/api.py` â€” FastAPI app to serve predictions
- `simulate_stream.py` â€” Script to send X_test transactions to the API
- `app/dashboard.py` â€” Streamlit dashboard for monitoring
- `data/X_test.csv` â€” Test data with features and actual label (`Class`)
- `requirements.txt` â€” All dependencies
- `screenshots/` â€” Screenshots of API and dashboard

## How to Run (Step by Step)

1. **Clone this repo and install requirements**
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd fraud-detection-mlops
pip install -r requirements.txt



2. **Train and save the model using notebooks in `notebooks/`**
 - Export model to `models/fraud_xgb.joblib`
 - Add `Class` to `X_test` and save as `data/X_test.csv`

3. **Start the FastAPI server**
uvicorn app.api:app --reload



4. **Simulate transaction scoring (with streaming and logging)**
python simulate_stream.py



5. **Launch the Streamlit dashboard**
streamlit run app/dashboard.py


 - Open the browser link shown in the terminal.

"...": "...",
"TimeSinceLastTxn": 0.0
}



Response:
{
"fraud_probability": 0.001,
"fraud_prediction": 0
}
