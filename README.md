# End-to-End Credit Card Fraud Detection ML Pipeline ðŸš€

## Overview

A fully production-style machine learning solution for detecting credit card fraud in real time. This project features in-depth EDA, feature engineering, model training with XGBoost, REST API deployment using FastAPI, a transaction streaming simulator, and a live monitoring dashboard with Streamlit. It follows best practices for MLOps and is perfect as a portfolio centerpiece.

## Quickstart âš¡

1. **Clone & Install**
    ```
    git clone [(https://github.com/vishnu-0567/Transaction-Fraud-Detection)]
    cd fraud-detection-mlops
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Train Model & Export Artifacts**
    - Use notebooks for data prep, feature engineering, and model training.
    - Export final model to `models/fraud_xgb.joblib`.

3. **Serve Model as API**
    ```
    uvicorn app.api:app --reload
    ```

4. **Simulate Transactions or Batch-Predict Test Set (API Method)**
    - Ensure `X_test.csv` includes all features the model expects.
    ```
    python predict_x_test_api.py
    ```
    - Predictions are logged to `stream_predictions.csv`.

5. **Run Streamlit Dashboard**
    ```
    streamlit run app/dashboard.py
    ```
    - Open `http://localhost:8501` to see real-time model results and metrics.

## Results

- **ROC-AUC:** 0.98+
- **Recall (fraud):** 0.83
- **Precision (fraud):** 0.80
- **Streaming and API-based scoring successful**
- **Live dashboard for monitoring and performance review**

---

## How to Extend

- Add email/SMS alerting for fraud spikes or model drift
- Integrate retraining triggers when performance drops
- Deploy API on cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- CI/CD: automate model rebuild and redeployment
